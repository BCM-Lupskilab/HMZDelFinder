Download HMZDelFinder.R and example_run.R to your working directory\r\n2. Collect BAMs and VCFs for all samples you want to include in the analysis\r\n3. Generate RPKM files from BAMs (e.g. using utility provided by CoNIFER http://conifer.sourceforge.net/)\r\n4. Collect RPKM files in the single directory\r\n5. Obtain your design bed file \r\n6. In the example_run.R, replace paths (PATHS section) according to location of your data\r\n7. execute example_run.R\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
